## Framer X 是什么?

[Framer X](https://framer.com/x) 是一个强大的交互设计工具。其 Beta 测试版已于 2018 年 8 月 1 日发布并正收集试用反馈。请阅读 **[官方文档](https://framer.gitbook.io/framer/)**。

开发团队最近开了一个 Facebook group **[Framer X Beta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/framer.x.feedback/)** 用来收集 bug 报告、试用反馈、建议和问题。

Beta 1 里新增了一个设计商店，提供可复用的 UI 组件（由 NPM 强力驱动）。在商店里你可以找到许多诸如地图、随机图片生成器、视频和音频播放器、设计系统套件（iOS & Android）等等交互式的设计和代码组件。

Framer X Beta 1 版中 React 组件 **仅支持 `TypeScript`**。`ES6` 预计需最终发布版才支持。
